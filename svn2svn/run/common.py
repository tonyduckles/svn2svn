    Given an initial starting path+rev, walk the SVN history backwards to inspect the
    ancestry of that path, optionally seeing if it traces back to stop_base_path.

    Build an array of copyfrom_path and copyfrom_revision pairs for each of the "svn copy"'s.
    If we find a copyfrom_path which stop_base_path is a substring match of (e.g. we crawled
    back to the initial branch-copy from trunk), then return the collection of ancestor
    paths.  Otherwise, copyfrom_path has no ancestry compared to stop_base_path.

    This is useful when comparing "trunk" vs. "branch" paths, to handle cases where a
    file/folder was renamed in a branch and then that branch was merged back to trunk.

    'svn_repos_url' is the full URL to the root of the SVN repository,
      e.g. 'file:///path/to/repo'
    'start_path' is the path in the SVN repo to the source path to start checking
      ancestry at, e.g. '/branches/fix1/projectA/file1.txt'.
    'start_rev' is the revision to start walking the history of start_path backwards from.
    'stop_base_path' is the path in the SVN repo to stop tracing ancestry once we've reached,
      i.e. the target path we're trying to trace ancestry back to, e.g. '/trunk'.
